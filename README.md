SNT is [ImageJ](https://imagej.net/)'s framework for semi-automated tracing, visualization, quantitative analyses and modeling of neuronal morphology. For tracing, SNT supports modern multidimensional microscopy data, and highly-customizable routines. For data analysis, SNT features advanced visualization tools, access to all major morphology databases, and support for whole-brain circuitry data.

SNT can be used as a regular application or as a scripting library. Python (through [pyimagej](https://github.com/imagej/pyimagej)) and  all of SciJava's scripting languages are supported. It is distributed with [Fiji](https://imagej.net/Fiji) and supersedes the original [Simple Neurite Tracer](#backwards-compatibility) plug-in. It also incorporates several other neuroanatomy-related Fiji plugins. **See  [SNT's publication](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-021-01105-7)  and [techical notes](./NOTES.md) for details**.

## Overview

[![Overview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2439948/167173119-2e4bea60-38e6-437f-82a9-205700f83ae8.png)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01105-7)

## Features
For an overview of SNT capabilities have a look at the [showcase gallery](https://imagej.net/plugins/snt/#overview).

<details>
  <summary><b>Detailed List</b></summary>

### Tracing

* Semi-automated Tracing:
  
  * Support for up to 5D multidimensional images, including multichannel, and timelapse sequences
  * Support for both ImageJ1 and [ImgLib2](https://imagej.net/libs/imglib2/) data structures
  * Several bidirectional search algorithms (A\*, NBA\*, Fast marching) with adjustable cost functions allow for efficient computation of curvatures for a wide range of imagery, that are <u>up to 20x faster</u> relatively to the original _Simple Neurite Tracer_ plugin
  * Tracing in "secondary layers". This allows for paths to be computed on "enhanced" (pre-processed) images while interacting with the unfiltered, original image (or vice-versa). Toggling between the two data sources is immediate
  * Precise placement of nodes is aided by a local search that automatically snaps the cursor to neurites wihin a 3D neighborhood

* Auto-tracing:

  * Generation of traces from thresholded/filtered images
  * Machine learning: Built-in routines for training random forest classifiers on previously traced paths ([LabKit](https://github.com/juglab/labkit-ui)/[Trainable Weka segmentation](https://github.com/fiji/Trainable_Segmentation) bridges)

* Tracing can be interleaved with image processing routines

* Tracing is scriptable. Interactive scripts allow for real-time inspection of results

* Paths can be tagged, searched, grouped and filtered by morphometric properties (length, radius, etc.)

* Paths can be edited, i.e., a path can be linked or merged together, or split into two. Nodes can be moved, deleted, or inserted

* Post-hoc refinement of node positioning and radii by 'fitting' traces to the fluorescent signal associated with a path
  
### Analysis

* Extensive repertoire of metrics, namely those provided by [L-measure](http://cng.gmu.edu:8080/Lm/help/index.htm) and [NeuroM](https://github.com/BlueBrain/NeuroM). Metrics can be collected from groups of cells, single cells, or parts thereof

* Analysis based on neuropil annotations for whole-brain data such as [MouseLight](https://ml-neuronbrowser.janelia.org/)

* Direct access to public databases, including [FlyCircuit](http://www.flycircuit.tw), [Insect Brain Database](https://insectbraindb.org/app/), [MouseLight](https://ml-neuronbrowser.janelia.org/), [NeuroMorpho](http://neuromorpho.org/), and [Virtual Fly Brain](https://v2.virtualflybrain.org/)

* Built-in commands for immediate retrieval of statistical reports, including summary statistics, tests (two-sample _t_-test/one-way ANOVA), comparison plots and histograms

* Convex hull analyses

* Graph theory-based analyses

* Persistent homology-based analyses

* [Sholl](./NOTES.md) and Horton-Strahler analyses

* Image processing workflows: Reconstructions can be converted to masks and ROIs. Voxel intensities can be profiled around traced paths
  
### Visualization

* Quantitative visualizations: Display neurons color coded by morphometric traits, or neuropil annotations. 

* Publication-quality visualizations:  Neuronal reconstructions, diagrams, plots and histograms can be exported as vector graphics

* [Reconstruction Viewer](https://imagej.net/SNT:_Reconstruction_Viewer): Standalone hardware-accelerated 3D visualization tool for both meshes and reconstructions.
  
  * Interactive and programmatic scenes (controlled rotations, panning, zoom, scaling, animation,  "dark/light mode", etc.)
  * Customizable views: Interactive management of scene elements, controls for transparency, color interpolation, lightning, path smoothing, etc. Ability to render both local and remote files on the same scene
  * Built-in support for several template brains: Drosophila, [zebrafish](https://fishatlas.neuro.mpg.de/), and Allen CCF (Allen Mouse Brain Atlas)

* [sciview](https://github.com/scenerygraphics/sciview) integration

* Graph Viewer: A dedicated viewer for graph-theory-based diagrams
  
  * Display reconstructions as dendrograms
  * Quantitative connectivity graphs for single cells and groups of cells
  
### Scripting

* Almost every aspect of the program can be scripted in any of the IJ2 supported languages, or from Python through [pyimagej](https://github.com/imagej/pyimagej)

* Detailed [documentation](https://imagej.net/SNT:_Scripting) and examples, including Python [notebooks](https://github.com/morphonets/SNT/tree/master/notebooks), and [end-to-end examples](https://github.com/morphonets/SNTmanuscript)

* Headless scripts supported

* (Experimental) Script Recorder
  
### Modeling

* Biophysical modeling of neuronal growth is performed through [Cortex3D (Cx3D)](https://github.com/morphonets/cx3d) and [sciview](https://docs.scenery.graphics/sciview/ "SciView"), in which a modified version of [Cx3D](https://github.com/morphonets/cx3d) grows neuronal processes with [sciview](https://docs.scenery.graphics/sciview/)’s data structures.
  
### Compatibility

* Support for multiple file formats including SWC, TRACES, JSON (MouseLight specification), and NDF (NeuronJ data file)

* Backwards compatibility: Special effort was put into backwards compatibility with  [Simple Neurite Tracer](https://github.com/fiji/SNT)  (including [TrakEM2](https://github.com/trakem2/TrakEM2) and [ITK](https://imagej.net/SNT:_Tubular_Geodesics) interaction)
  
* Aggregation of [legacy plugins](./NOTES.md)

## Installation

SNT is a [Fiji](https://imagej.net/Fiji) plugin, currently distributed through the *Neuroanatomy* [update site](https://imagej.net/Update_Sites).

The first time you start SNT from Fiji's menu structure *(Plugins>Neuroanatomy>SNT...*) you should be prompted for automatic subscription and download of required dependencies. If not:

1. Run the Fiji Updater (*Help › Update...*, the penultimate entry in the  *Help ›*  menu)
2. Click *Manage update sites*
3. Select the *Neuroanatomy* checkbox
4. Optionally, select the *sciview* checkbox. This is only required for extra [sciview](https://docs.scenery.graphics/sciview/) functionality
5. Click *Apply changes* and Restart Fiji. SNT commands are registered under _Plugins>Neuroanatomy>_ in the main menu and SNT scripts under _Templates>Neuroanatomy>_ in Fiji's Script Editor.

Problems? Have a look at the full [documentation](https://imagej.net/SNT).

## Developing

### On the cloud

Use this button to open the project on the cloud using [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io). No local installation necessary (although project may take a while to load).

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/morphonets/SNT) 

### Locally

1. Clone the main branch of this repository (use the green _code_ button above the list of files) 
2. Import the project into an IDE such as [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/)/[IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)/[NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/download/index.html):
   - In Eclipse: Run _Import> Existing Maven Projects_ and specify the path to the downloaded `SNT` folder in _Root Directory_
   - In IntelliJ: In the _Welcome Prompt_, choose _Open or Import_ and specify the path to the downloaded `SNT` folder
   - In NetBeans: Run _File> Open Project..._, select the downloaded `SNT` directory, and click on _Open Project_
3. In your IDE, set the compliance level for the Java compiler to Java 11. SNT is currently compiled with java 11, but is expected to run fine with newer Java versions. Versions prior to SNT v4.2.2 were developed using Java8. 
4. Wait for all the dependencies to be downloaded, and run [snt/gui/cmds/SNTLoaderCmd](./src/main/java/sc/fiji/snt/gui/cmds/SNTLoaderCmd.java). Alternatively, call `sc.fiji.snt.SNTUtils.startApp()` from any class.

> :information_source: By default, ImageJ1 cannot run in headless environments. To bypass this, Fiji uses a bytecode injection mechanism to patch ImageJ1 at runtime.
> However, this mechanism can be sensitive to the JVM in use. If you are unable to run SNTLoaderCmd from your IDE due to misterious `net.imagej.legacy.LegacyService` exceptions,
> try changing the JDK used by the project. A sure-to-work option is to use the same JDK being distributed with Fiji, e.g., by pointing your project to the JDK of a local Fiji install (i.e., a local `Fiji.app/java/` directory).
