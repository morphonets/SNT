/**
 * A specialized {@link ColorMapper} for applying color-coded mappings to 3D annotations.
 * <p>
 * AnnotationMapper enables quantitative visualization of 3D annotations by mapping
 * their properties to colors using lookup tables (LUTs). This is particularly
 * useful for visualizing brain regions, anatomical compartments, or other 3D
 * structures with color-coding based on their quantitative properties.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The mapper supports transparency control and automatically determines the value
 * range across all annotations to ensure proper color scaling. Currently, only
 * volume-based mapping is supported, but the architecture allows for future
 * extension to other annotation properties.
 * </p>
 * Example usage:
 * <pre>
 * Collection&lt;Annotation3D&gt; annotations = getAnnotations();
 * AnnotationMapper mapper = new AnnotationMapper(annotations);
 * mapper.setTransparency(50.0); // 50% transparency
 * mapper.map("volume", colorTable);
 * </pre>
