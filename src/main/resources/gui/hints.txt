# SNT Tips
# Lines starting with # are comments and will be ignored
# 'ctrlKey()'' will be replaced by 'Cmd' on macOS; 'Ctrl' on linux/Windows

# Navigation & Basic Shortcuts
Press G to select the path nearest to the cursor
Hold Shift+G to add multiple paths to your selection
Press H to temporarily hide all paths while held down
Use the Command Palette (ctrlKey()+Shift+P) to quickly find any action
Press Enter to shuttle focus between the tracing image and the SNT window
Double-click on a bookmark to navigate directly to that location
Press Shift+B to bookmark the cursor location
Most shortcuts are single keystrokes and are highlighted in menus/dialogs.

# Tracing
Enable cursor snapping (S) to auto-snap to the brightest voxel nearby
Press V to auto-click on the brightest voxel above/below the cursor
Press Y twice to quickly finish a path without confirmation dialogs
Press N twice to cancel a path including the start node
Use Alt+Click on an existing path to start a branch from that point
Press Shift+P to pause tracing operations temporarily
Overlay a MIP at low opacity (Options tab) to see the full structure while tracing

# Path Editing
Press Shift+E to enter Edit Mode for the selected path
In Edit Mode: D deletes, M moves, I inserts, and B brings nodes to the current Z-plane
Press R in Edit Mode to change the radius of the active node
Press L in Edit Mode to lock a node and prevent accidental changes
Press X in Edit Mode to split a tree at the active node

# Analysis
Use Quick Measurements for instant metrics without prompts
Color-code paths by morphometric properties via Path Manager→Analyze→Color Mapping
Run Sholl Analysis from any node using Alt+Shift+A
Create dendrograms using Analsis→Utilities→Create Dendrogram
Use Path Profiler to visualize intensity gradients along traced neurites
Compare cell groups statistically via Utilities→Compare Reconstructions...

# Visualization
Press 1/2/3 to toggle visibility filters for paths
Use the Reconstruction Viewer (3D tab) for interactive 3D visualization
Export publication-quality figures via Reconstruction Plotter (supports PDF/SVG)
Use Create Figure to generate multi-panel montages of reconstructions

# Data Management
Save timestamped backups with ctrlKey()+Shift+S (Backup Tracings)
Use File→Revert to Backup... to restore from previous saves
Load demo datasets (File→Load Demo Dataset) to practice or test features
Drag and drop SWC/TRACES files directly into the Path Manager to import them
Use the Script Recorder (Scripts menu) to generate code from GUI actions
