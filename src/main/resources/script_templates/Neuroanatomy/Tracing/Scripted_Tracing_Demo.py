version: 20231214
info:    Exemplifies how to programmatically perform A* tracing between two
         points without GUI interaction, which allows for automated tracing
         of relatively simple structures (e.g., neurospheres neurites,
         microtubule bundles, etc). In this demo, points are retrieved from the
         SWC file of SNT's "demo tree", effectively recreating the initial SWC
         data.
